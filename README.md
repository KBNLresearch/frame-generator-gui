Frame Generator GUI
===================

The [Frame Generator] (https://github.com/jlonij/frame-generator), created in collaboration with KB Fellow Joris van Eijnatten, is a tool for extracting topics, the most relevant keywords and words related to those keywords (forming so-called frames) from a collection of sample texts provided by the user. This repository contains a web interface to the Frame Generator that extracts and visualises keywords and frames.
