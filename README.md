# Frame Generator GUI
Online demo of the [Frame Generator](https://github.com/jlonij/frame-generator) providing a graphical user interface for its main functionality as well as a basic visualization of the resulting keywords and frames.

## Requirements
Expects a local instance of the [Frame Generator](https://github.com/jlonij/frame-generator) running as a web application at `http://localhost:8091`. This can be adjusted by changing the `url` value in [frame-generator-gui/js/global.js](https://github.com/jlonij/frame-generator-gui/blob/master/js/global.js).
