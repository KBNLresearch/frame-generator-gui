# Frame Generator GUI
Online demo for the [Frame Generator] (https://github.com/jlonij/frame-generator), providing a graphical user interface to its main functionality and a basic visualisation of the resulting keywords and frames.

## Requirements
Expects a local instance of the [Frame Generator] (https://github.com/jlonij/frame-generator) running as a web application at `http://localhost:8091`. This can be adjusted by changing the `url` value in [frame-generator-gui/js/global.js] (https://github.com/jlonij/frame-generator-gui/blob/master/js/global.js).
